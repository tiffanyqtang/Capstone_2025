# Integrative Analysis of the Cervicovaginal Microbiome and Systemic Inflammation in HPV Persistence among Nigerian Women

Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers, yet it remains a major cause of death among women in many low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The leading cause of cervical cancer is persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (hrHPV), especially types 16 and 18. While most HPV infections resolve naturally, a subset of women experience persistent infections that can eventually lead to cancer. The biological factors that determine whether an infection clears or persists are not yet fully understood.

This project investigates two key biological systems that may shape HPV outcomes:

- **Cervicovaginal microbiome**: A healthy vaginal microbiome is typically dominated by *Lactobacillus* species, which help maintain an acidic environment and protect against infections. When this balance is disrupted, bacterial vaginosis (BV) can occur, resulting in a more diverse microbial community often dominated by anaerobic bacteria. This shift has been associated with increased risk of HPV persistence and progression to cervical disease.

- **Systemic immune signaling**: The immune system, particularly cytokines, plays a critical role in controlling infection and may be influenced by microbial imbalances. Dysregulated cytokine expression has been linked to persistent HPV infections.

### ðŸ“Œ Research Focus
This project examines how BV status is associated with systemic immune signaling, as measured by blood-based cytokine profiles, in a Nigerian cohort. Nigeria carries one of the highest burdens of cervical cancer globally, yet remains significantly underrepresented in biomedical research. By exploring how BV may alter immune function through cytokine expression, this work aims to reveal biological pathways contributing to HPV persistence or clearance, ultimately informing prevention and early detection strategies tailored to underserved populations.

### ðŸ“š Background
- **Microbiome & HPV persistence**: Non-*Lactobacillus*-dominated microbiomes, particularly those enriched in *Gardnerella* or *Atopobium*, have been linked to HPV persistence (Usyk et al. 2022; Musa et al. 2023).
- **Immune signaling**: Specific blood cytokines are predictive of HPV persistence (Usyk et al. 2024; Li et al. 2019).
- **Microbiomeâ€“immune interactions**: Dysbiosis can drive chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation (Zhou et al. 2021; Ntuli et al. 2022).
- **Cohort source**: HPV outcome data derive from a longitudinal study (Mbulaiteye et al. 2013), which classified infections based on serial PCR testing.

While these domains have been studied separately, few projects have jointly examined BV status and systemic cytokine profilesâ€”particularly in African populations, where such insights are urgently needed.

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Integrate **microbiome composition**, **systemic cytokine markers**, and **clinical metadata**  
- Use **machine learning tools** to build predictive models of HPV persistence  
- Identify potential **biomarkers of cervical cancer risk**  
- Inform early triage and **prevention strategies** tailored to underserved populations  

### ðŸ§ª Hypothesis
We hypothesize that:
1. **BV status is associated with systemic immune signaling**  
2. Combined patterns of vaginal microbiome composition and circulating cytokines can predict BV status  
3. These integrated patterns may ultimately inform risk stratification for persistent HPV infection
