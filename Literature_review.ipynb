    "Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is a critical factor in the development of cervical cancer, yet the biological determinants of viral persistence versus clearance remain incompletely understood. Recent research has highlighted the significant roles of the cervicovaginal microbiome and systemic inflammatory responses in influencing hrHPV infection outcomes. This literature review synthesizes current studies on microbial community composition, immune profiling, particularly cytokine signaling, and the application of machine learning for predictive modeling. By examining these interrelated factors, the review establishes the scientific foundation and methodological precedent for my integrative analysis of the cervicovaginal microbiome and systemic inflammation in hrHPV persistence among Nigerian women."

    "\tThis publication is directly relevant to the project’s central research question of “how does the cervicovaginal microbiome influences hrHPV persistence”. The study investigates the association between vaginal microbial community composition and the natural history of HPV infection, using a large, longitudinal cohort of women. Like my proposed project, it focuses on identifying microbial features that correlate with HPV clearance versus persistence, offering strong conceptual and methodological alignment. It provides compelling evidence that specific microbial signatures, particularly dominance by non-Lactobacillus taxa such as Gardnerella and Atopobium, are associated with increased risk of persistent hrHPV infection, which is a key focus of the research.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Relevant Aspects:**\n",
    "\tThe study applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing (targeting the V4 region, similar to the data I will be working with) to characterize vaginal microbiomes and used supervised machine learning models, including random forest classifiers, to predict HPV outcomes based on microbial features. These methods mirror the tools and analytical approaches proposed in my project. Additionally, the paper integrates demographic and behavioral metadata into its modeling, which reinforces the importance of multi-layered data in predicting HPV persistence, an approach I plan to extend by incorporating systemic cytokine profiles as well. This publication also underscores the clinical relevance of microbiome-based biomarkers for stratifying women by cervical cancer risk, which supports the translational potential of my work.\n",

It reflects up-to-date sequencing technologies, bioinformatic pipelines, and statistical modeling approaches. The methodological similarities between this study and my project confirm that the proposed workflows (e.g., DADA2, random forest modeling, diversity analysis) are aligned with best practices in the field. Additionally, its recent publication demonstrates that the field remains actively engaged in uncovering microbial determinants of HPV persistence, reinforcing the relevance and novelty of my contribution, especially given the focus on an underrepresented Nigerian population.\n",

    "**Applicability:**\n",
    "\tAlthough the study population in this paper was not African, the findings are highly applicable across geographic contexts. The microbiome features associated with HPV persistence appear consistent with known patterns of vaginal dysbiosis observed globally. This enhances the generalizability of their conclusions and supports my hypothesis that similar microbial predictors may influence hrHPV persistence in Nigerian women. Furthermore, my inclusion of systemic inflammatory markers (cytokines) adds a valuable host immune dimension that was not present in this paper, positioning my work to extend the existing literature by offering a more integrative model of HPV pathogenesis. Thus, while not identical in design, the publication supports my methodology and rationale and also highlights how my project adds a novel layer of biological complexity.\n"

    "The study used 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V3–V4 region) to examine vaginal microbiome profiles in hrHPV-positive women and conducted metabolomic profiling to link microbial taxa with functional outputs. It reported that hrHPV infection is associated with a shift toward non-Lactobacillus-dominated microbiomes, particularly increased abundance of Gardnerella, Prevotella, and Sneathia. This supports my project's focus on microbial signatures predictive of hrHPV persistence. Although my project uses V4-region 16S sequencing and does not include metabolomics, the analytical frameworks (e.g., alpha/beta diversity, differential abundance testing) and findings on microbial dysbiosis directly complement my study design. The paper also underscores the need to integrate microbial and host factors in understanding infection dynamics.\n",

    "The study combines 16S rRNA gene sequencing of cervical samples with genotyping of immune-related host variants (e.g., TLR, cytokine, and HLA genes). It demonstrates that certain microbial community structures, particularly low Lactobacillus abundance and high diversity, are associated with persistent hrHPV infection. Additionally, it finds that specific genetic variants related to immune signaling pathways modulate susceptibility to persistence. This is highly relevant to my analysis, as I will examine systemic cytokine levels as a readout of host immune function, offering a complimentary but non-genetic lens on immune modulation. The use of multivariate modeling to integrate microbial and host factors closely parallels the analytical strategy I plan to apply.\n",

These taxonomic shifts are consistent with other studies and highly relevant to the taxa I will investigate. Although the study focuses on cross-sectional HPV status and not persistence, the microbiome alterations identified are similar to those linked with persistence in other literature, suggesting they may represent stable dysbiotic states. The study also used diversity metrics and community state typing, approaches that I will apply in my analysis.\n",

The authors found that elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and decreased interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels were associated with increased disease severity, and a combined cytokine score outperformed traditional cytology in predicting HSIL risk. These findings underscore the importance of inflammatory biomarkers in understanding HPV persistence and progression, aligning with my project's focus on integrating immune profiling with microbiome data to predict HPV outcomes in Nigerian women.\n",

    "\tThe study utilized a cohort of 146 women, including those with long-term high-risk HPV infection and varying degrees of cervical lesions. Cytokine levels in vaginal fluid were measured using cytometric bead array assays, and the resulting cytokine scores were compared to ThinPrep cytology tests (TCTs) for diagnostic accuracy. The researchers found that the cytokine score, incorporating IL-6 and IL-2 levels, had a higher area under the curve (AUC) than TCTs for detecting HSILs. Additionally, HPV-positive patients with high cytokine scores exhibited an increased risk of developing HSIL within three years, with a hazard ratio of 3.12. These results suggest that cytokine profiling can serve as a valuable adjunct to cytology in triaging HPV-positive women and predicting disease progression.\n",
