    "**State the problem**: Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), particularly types 16 and 18, is a major driver of cervical cancer. However, not all hrHPV infections persist; many are cleared naturally. Understanding the factors that influence viral persistence is critical for identifying individuals at elevated risk. This project investigates how the cervicovaginal microbiome and systemic inflammatory cytokines impact the persistence or clearance of hrHPV in a Nigerian cohort.\n"

    "**What’s its biological relevance:** Cervical cancer remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The biological mechanisms by which the host immune environment and microbiome influence HPV infection outcomes are not fully understood. Identifying microbial or cytokine biomarkers predictive of hrHPV persistence could improve early detection and stratification of high-risk individuals, and potentially guide targeted interventions or vaccine development.\n"

Such integrative analyses are underexplored in African populations and can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of cervical cancer risk.
